# Stagii.md

## Description

Stagii.md is a specialized platform designed to streamline the internship search process. It connects students and graduates with diverse internship opportunities offered by companies. This README provides essential information for users, contributors, and maintainers.

## Technical Framework and Tools

### Backend:

- **Framework:** The backend of our application is developed using servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages) within the Tomcat Apache server. Servlets handle the server-side logic, while JSP enables the creation of dynamic web pages.

### Frontend:

- **Languages:** The frontend is built using fundamental web technologies, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior. This approach ensures a lightweight and responsive user interface.

### Database:

- **Database System:** The application's data is stored and managed in a MySQL database. MySQL provides a reliable and scalable relational database solution, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Deployment:

- **Backend Deployment:** The backend, powered by servlets and JSP, is deployed using the Tomcat Apache server, providing a robust and efficient runtime environment.

- **Frontend Deployment:** The frontend, consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is hosted on a platform like Vercel. Vercel ensures seamless deployment and hosting for static assets, enhancing the overall performance of the frontend.

- **Database Deployment:** The MySQL database is deployed and managed as part of the overall application architecture. It plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving data, ensuring the integrity of the information.
